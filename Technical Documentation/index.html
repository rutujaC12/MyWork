                      <li>Case Study: Amazon Go, a cashier-less convenience store, employs computer vision to track customer movements
                         and items picked off the shelves. The system automatically charges customers for the items they take as they 
                         exit the store.</li>
                      <li>Example: Zara, a fashion retailer, uses computer vision for inventory management, automating the process 
                        of tracking and restocking items on store shelves.</li>
                    </ul>
